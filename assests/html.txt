  My Dearest Hajarah Oyinkansola ADUNNI ,

Happy Birthday, my love. ðŸŒ¹

Today, the world celebrates the day you arrived but my heart celebrates every single day youâ€™ve been in my life. You are more than just special to me, you are peace in my chaos, a light in my darkness, and the soft place my soul calls home.

Your smile heals what words canâ€™t touch. Your presence is a blessing I never take for granted. You inspire me to be better, dream deeper, and love harder just by being exactly who you are.

On this day, I wish for you the kind of joy you quietly give to others. I wish for your heart to feel as full as you make mine. And I hope the universe showers you with every good thing, because no one deserves it more.

Thank you for being my safe place, my heartâ€™s favorite rhythm, and my reason to believe in something beautifully real.

Happy Birthday, Hajarah. I love you more than words can ever say. ðŸ’–

Forever Yours,
YahayaÂ Mobolaji.
